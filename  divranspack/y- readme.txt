Do not upload any of the addons to garrysmod.org. Thank you

---- Advanced Entity Marker
This is already included in the UWSVN.

---- Advanced Prop Spawner
This allows you to set a small position offset and an angle offset, as well as change the color, 
material, etc of the prop before spawning it. You also get a ghost preview of the prop.

---- Advanced Weld Latch
This allows you to weld or nocollide multiple props to 1 single prop.

---- Archive:
In the archive I put old or useless mods.

---- Divrans Evolve Plugins
Some plugins for Evolve.

---- Divrans Various E2 Plugins
Some useful, some useless E2 extensions.
Put these in
addons\wire\lua\entities\gmod_wire_expression2\core\custom

---- Exit Point Controller (Aka Multi Exit Point Controller)
Allows you to set the exit point of multiple vehicles at once.

---- Gyropod 2
A total remake of the Gyropod. Features less and more compact inputs (Instead of PitchMult, YawMult, RollMult, etc, 
it uses 1 anglular force input)

---- Holographic Text Screen
A simple text screen which draws the text in midair.

---- Laser Tool damage for PewPew
Makes the Laser Tool entity deal PewPew damage.

---- MW2 name colors
Allows you to use the MW2 color syntax (ie ^2 ^9 ^6 etc) in GMod.

---- NoCollide Remover
A tool that CAN remove nocollides, unlike garry's crap tool.

---- Non-GMod things
What the folder name says

---- PewPew
This is one of my major projects. It's a GCombat-like addon. Read more here: http://www.wiremod.com/forum/wiremod-lua-coding/18035-pewpew-new-gcombat.html

---- PewPew v2
Most of the things in PewPew v1 have been rewritten from scratch. A lot more optimized, etc.
WARNING: DO NOT USE THIS ADDON YET. IT IS NOT YET STABLE, AND IS STILL PRE-ALPHA.

---- Resource Burner
To get rid of excess resources in SB3

---- Teleporter
This is a remake of the wire hoverdrive. Much cleaner code, etc

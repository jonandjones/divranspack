---- Divrans Admin Mod:
This is my very own Admin Mod

---- Divrans Chat Sound
This adds the CSS Chat sound back to your game (The one that was removed in an update)
NOTE!!!! Doesn't need CSS to work!!

---- Divrans Chat Temporary Fix
This fixes the bug where you can't see the chat, and you must look in the console all the time.
Use this as a temporary fix until you can fix the actual problem.
NOTE!!!! If you see TWO messages at once, that means your REAL chat is WORKING and you DO NOT NEED THIS FIX.
NOTE!!!! I have not had the chance to TEST IT yet, as I do not have this bug.

---- Divrans Vehicle Camera Fix
This addon fixes the view in the jalopy.
This is only temporary and should not be used forever.
Since I am so noob at lua coding, it disables the use of 3rd person in the jalopy.

---- Divrans Various E2 Plugins
Put these in
addons\wire\lua\entities\gmod_wire_expression2\core\custom
or it will not work!

---- Divrans SoundPlay
This will play a sound whenever anyone in the server writes a command
Put in addons folder.

---- Divrans Custom Spawn Point SENT
This adds a mobile custom spawn point SENT to your game.
It is almost exactly the same as the Mobile spawn point found on Gmod.org.
